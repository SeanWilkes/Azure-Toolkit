# Azure-Toolkit
Azure Cloud Infrastructure Toolkit
This repo is a personal and professional lab for building and managing cloud infrastructure (Microsoft Azure). It's structed the way a real environment would be, not a random sandbox.
The Focus Here is simple:
  -Automate common sysadmin and cloud tasks
  -Build repeatable deployment workflows
  -Keep everything organized and documented
# Folder Breakdown
  -01_Scripts - Powershell, Bash, Python & mixed scripts for resource creaton, networking, identity and maintenance
  -02_Templates - ARM, Bicep, Terraform, and pipeline templates
  -03_Modules - Reusable code snippets and functions
  -04_Configs - Environment Configs (no secrets), parameter files, and structure for dev/test/prod.
  -05_Documentation - SOPs, cheat sheets, and quick references
  -06_Logs - Output logs from deployments and automations
  -07_Archive - Old versions, experiments and retired code
# Security & Privacy
No real credentials or internal systems are stored here. Everything is either demo, lab or redacted to keep it clean and professional.
# Purpose
This is a growing toolkit built to mirror how real-world infrastructure gets managed and deployed. It refleccts how I work: organized, intentional, and automation-first.
